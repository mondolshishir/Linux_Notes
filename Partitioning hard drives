Understanding different partition types
------------------------------------------

Linux partitions ---->  Use this option to create a partition for an ext2, ext3, or ext4 filesystem type that is added directly to a partition on your hard disk
                        (or other storage medium). The xfs filesystem type can also be used on a Linux partition. (In fact, xfs is now the default filesystem type for RHEL 8 systems.)
LVM partitions ------>  Create an LVM partition if you plan to create or add to an LVM volume group.
                        LVMs give you more flexibility in growing, shrinking, and moving partitions later than regular partitions do.
RAID partitions ----->  Create two or more RAID partitions to create a RAID array. These partitions should be on separate disks to create an effective RAID array.
                        RAID arrays can help improve performance, reliability, or both as those features relate to reading, writing, and storing your data.
Swap partitions ----->  Create a swap partition to extend the amount of virtual memory available on your system.
