Using Other Administrative Accounts
------------------------------------
lp:  ------->  User owns such things as the /var/log/cups printing log file and various printing cache and spool files. The home directory for lp is /var/spool/lpd.
apache: ---->  User can set up content files and directories on an Apache web server. It is primarily used to run the web server processes (httpd) in RHEL and Fedora systems,
               while the www-data user runs the Apache service (apache2) on Ubuntu systems.
avahi: ----->  User runs the avahi daemon process to provide zeroconf services on your network.
chrony: ---->  User runs the chronyd daemon, which is used to maintain accurate computer clocks.
postfix: --->  User owns various mail server spool directories and files. The user runs the daemon processes used to provide the postfix service (master).
bin: ------->  User owns many commands in /bin in traditional UNIX systems. This is not the case in some Linux systems (such as Ubuntu, Fedora, and Gentoo)
               because root owns most executable files. The home directory of bin is /bin.

news: ------>  User could do administration of Internet news services, depending on how you set permission for /var/spool/news and other news-related resources.
               The home directory for news is /etc/news.
rpc: -------> User runs the remote procedure calls daemon (rpcbind), which is used to receive calls for services on the host system. The NFS service uses the RPC service.
