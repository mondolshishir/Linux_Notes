Administrative Configurations
------------------

/sbin: --------->   Originally contained commands needed to boot your system, including commands for checking filesystems (fsck) and turning on swap devices (swapon).
/usr/sbin: ----->   Originally contained commands for such things as managing useraccounts (such as useradd) and checking processes that are holding files open (such as lsof).
/etc:  --------->  This directory contains most of the basic Linux system configuration files.
/etc/cron*: ---->   Directories in this set contain files that define how the crond utility runs applications on a daily (cron.daily), hourly (cron.hourly), monthly (cron. monthly), or weekly (cron.weekly) schedule.
/etc/cups: ----->   Contains files used to configure the CUPS printing service.
/etc/default: -->   Contains files that set default values for various utilities. For example, the file for the useradd command defines the default group number, home directory, password expiration date, shell, and skeleton directory (/etc/skel) used when creating a new user account.
/etc/httpd: ---->   Contains a variety of files used to configure the behavior of your Apache web server (specifically, the httpd daemon process). (On Ubuntu and other Linux systems, /etc/apache or /etc/apache2 is used instead.)
/etc/mail: ----->   Contains files used to configure your sendmail mail transport agent.
/etc/postfix: -->   Contains configuration files for the postfix mail transport agent.
/etc/ppp: ------>   Contains several configuration files used to set up Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) so that you can have your computer dial out to the Internet. (PPP was more commonly used when dial-up modems were popular.
/etc/rc?.d: ---->   There is a separate rc?.d directory for each valid system state: rc0.d (shutdown state), rc1.d (single-user state), rc2.d (multiuser state), rc3.d (multiuser plus networking state), rc4.d (user-defined state), rc5.d (multiuser, networking, plus GUI login state), and rc6.d (reboot state). These directories are maintained for compatibility with old UNIX SystemV init services.
/etc/security: ->   Contains files that set a variety of default security conditions for your computer, basically defining how authentication is done. These files are part of the pam (pluggable authentication modules) package.
/etc/skel: ----->   Any files contained in this directory are automatically copied to a user’s home directory when that user is added to the system. By default, most of these files are dot (.) files, such as .kde (a directory for setting KDE desktop defaults) and .bashrc (for setting default values used with the bash shell).
/etc/sysconfig:->   Contains important system configuration files that are created and maintained by various services (including firewalld, samba, and most networking services). These files are critical for Linux distributions, such as Fedoraand RHEL, that use GUI administration tools but are not used on other Linux systems at all.
/etc/systemd: -->   Contains files associated with the systemd facility, for managing the boot process and system services. In particular, when you run systemctl commands to enable and disable services, files that make that happen are stored in subdirectories of the /etc/systemd system directory.
/etc/xinetd.d: ->   Contains a set of files, each of which defines an on-demand network service that the xinetd daemon listens for on a particular port. When the xinetd daemon process receives a request for a service, it uses the information in these files to determine which daemon processes to start to handle the request.
aliases: ------->   Can contain distribution lists used by the Linux mail services. (This file is located in /etc/mail in Ubuntu when you install the sendmail package.)
bashrc: -------->   Sets system-wide defaults for bash shell users. (This may be called bash. bashrc on some Linux distributions.)
crontab: ------->   Sets times for running automated tasks and variables associated with the cron facility (such as the SHELL and PATH associated with cron). csh.cshrc (or cshrc): Sets system-wide defaults for csh (C shell) users.
exports: ------->   Contains a list of local directories that are available to be shared by remote computers using the Network File System (NFS).
fstab: --------->   Identifies the devices for common storage media (hard disk, DVD, CD-ROM, and so on) and locations where they are mounted in the Linux system. This is used by the mount command to choose which filesystems to mount when the system first boots.
group: --------->   Identifies group names and group IDs (GIDs) that are defined on the system. Group permissions in Linux are defined by the second of three sets of rwx (read, write, execute) bits associated with each file and directory.
gshadow: ------->   Contains shadow passwords for groups.
host.conf: ----->   Used by older applications to set the locations in which domain names (for example, redhat.com) are searched for on TCP/IP networks (such as the Internet). By default, the local hosts file is searched and then any name server entries in resolv.conf.
hostname: ------>   Contains the hostname for the local system (beginning in RHEL 7 and recent Fedora and Ubuntu systems).
hosts: --------->   Contains IP addresses and hostnames that you can reach from your computer. (Usually this file is used just to store names of computers on your LAN or small private network.)
inittab: ------->   On earlier Linux systems, contained information that defined which programs start and stop when Linux boots, shuts down, or goes into different states in between. This configuration file was the first one read when Linux started the init process. This file is no longer used on Linux systems that support systemd.
mtab: ---------->   Contains a list of filesystems that are currently mounted.
mtools.conf: --->   Contains settings used by DOS tools in Linux.
named.conf: ---->   Contains DNS settings if you are running your own DNS server (bind or bind9 package).
nsswitch.conf: ->   Contains name service switch settings, for identifying where critical system information (user accounts, hostname-to-address mappings, and so on) comes from (local host or via network services).
ntp.conf: ------>   Includes information needed to run the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
passwd: -------->   Stores account information for all valid users on the local system. Also includes other information, such as the home directory and default shell. (Rarely includes the user passwords themselves, which are typically stored in the /etc/ shadow file.)
printcap: ------>   Contains definitions for the printers configured for your computer. (If the printcap file doesn’t exist, look for printer information in the /etc/cups directory.)
profile: ------->   Sets system-wide environment and startup programs for all users. This file is read when the user logs in.
protocols: ----->   Sets protocol numbers and names for a variety of Internet services.
rpc: ----------->   Defines remote procedure call names and numbers.
services: ------>   Defines TCP/IP and UDP service names and their port assignments.
shadow: -------->   Contains encrypted passwords for users who are defined in the passwd file. (This is viewed as a more secure way to store passwords than the original encrypted password in the passwd file. The passwd file needs to be publicly readable, whereas the shadow file can be unreadable by all but the root user.)
shells: -------->   Lists the shell command-line interpreters (bash, sh, csh, and so on) that are available on the system as well as their locations.
sudoers: ------->   Sets commands that can be run by users, who may not otherwise have permission to run the command, using the sudo command. In particular, this file is used to provide selected users with root permission.
rsyslog.conf: -->   Defines what logging messages are gathered by the rsyslogd daemon and in which files they are stored. (Typically, log messages are stored in files contained in the /var/log directory.)
xinetd.conf: --->   Contains simple configuration information used by the xinetd daemon process. This file mostly p
