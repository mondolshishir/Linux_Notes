Using Cockpit browser-based administration
---------------
Cockpit is the best browser-based Linux system administration tool that I have ever seen. It
brings together a range of Linux administrative activities into one interface and taps into
a diverse set of Linux APIs using cockpit-bridge. As someone doing Linux administration,
however, you just need to know that you will get a consistent and stable way of administering your systems with Cockpit.
Getting started with Cockpit is as simple as enabling the cockpit socket and pointing a
web browser at the Cockpit service. Because of Cockpit’s plug-in design, there are new tools
being created all the time that you can add to your system’s Cockpit interface.


1. If Cockpit is not already installed, do the following:
 # dnf install cockpit
2. Log in as root user, and enable the Cockpit socket:
 # systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket
 Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/sockets.target.wants/
cockpit.socket
 → /usr/lib/systemd/system/cockpit.socket.
3. Open your web browser to port 9090 on the system where you just enabled Cockpit.
You can use the hostname or IP address. Port 9090 is configured for https by
default, although you can reconfigure that if you like to use http. Here are examples of addresses to type into your browser’s address bar:
 https://host1.example.com:9090/
 https://192.168.122.114:9090/
